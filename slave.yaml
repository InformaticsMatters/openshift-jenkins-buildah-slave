# An OpenShift slave image template.
#
# oc process -f slave.yaml | oc create -f -
#
# This is a template for an ImageStream recognised by Jenkins as a viable
# image for the creation of slave instances due to the presence of the label
# `role` with value `jenkins-slave`. We refer to this image in our
# Jenkins pipeline agent with the label defined by `SLAVE_LABEL`
# (`buildah-slave` by default), i.e.:
#
#   agent {
#     label 'buildah-slave'
#   }
#
# For more information refer to this project's README.md
